data1：The AIS data provided by the Danish Maritime Authority were used in the experiment. The dataset covers the period from January 1, 2019 to March 31, 2019. The geographic location is a rectangular region defined by coordinates (55.5°N, 10.3°E) to (58.0°N, 13.0°E). The region is located in the sea area of northern Europe, specifically between Denmark and Sweden, and covers part of the North Sea and the Kattegat Strait.

data2: The dataset is provided by CLS-Collecte Localisa-tion Satellites and Erwan Guegueniat. The dataset covers the period from January 1,2017 to March 31,2017. The geographic location is a rectangular region defined by coordinates (47.0°N, 7.0°W) to (50.0°N, 4.0°W), The Ushant area is the entrance to the English Channel, which is the focus of maritime surveillance due to the separa-tion of ship traffic and heavy traffic.


Due to the involvement of unfinished projects, only a portion of the code can be made public. The specific code will be updated once the project is completed.
